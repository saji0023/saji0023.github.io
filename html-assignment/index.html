    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! I'm Adithyan Sajith, an international student currently pursuing a diploma in Interactive Media Design.
        Choosing this field has been an exciting journey, as it perfectly blends my creativity with my interest in technology.
        The program offers a comprehensive curriculum that covers various aspects of digital media, from graphic design to user
        experience, allowing me to explore different facets of interactive content creation. Being in a diverse academic environment
        in Canada has provided me with unique perspectives and insights, enhancing my learning experience and preparing me for a dynamic
        career in the media industry.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a strong passion for playing video games. This hobby not only provides me with
        entertainment but also inspires my work in interactive media design. Through gaming, I have developed an appreciation for
        well-crafted narratives, engaging gameplay mechanics, and the intricate design elements that contribute to immersive experiences.
        This passion drives me to create innovative and user-centric designs in my projects, aiming to contribute to the gaming industry in
        the future. Balancing my studies and my love for gaming has been a fulfilling experience, fueling my creativity and motivation to
        excel in my chosen field.
